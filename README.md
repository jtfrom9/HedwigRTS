## How To Use As Packages

Add below path from Unity Package Manager as git packages.
```
https://github.com/jtfrom9/HedwigRTS.git?path=Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore
https://github.com/jtfrom9/HedwigRTS.git?path=Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore.inputobservable
```

Also you need to setup dependencies by yourself because Unity does not support package dependencies

See 
- [Packages/manifest.json](Packages/manifest.json)
- [Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore/dependencies.json](Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore/dependencies.json)
- [Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore.inputobservable/dependencies.json](Packages/com.jtfrom9.hedwig.rtscore.inputobservable/dependencies.json)
